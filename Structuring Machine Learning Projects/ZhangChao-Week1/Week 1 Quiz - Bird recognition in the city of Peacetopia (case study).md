### Problem Statement
#### This example is adapted from a real production application, but with details disguised to protect confidentiality.

#### You are a famous researcher in the City of Peacetopia. The people of Peacetopia have a common characteristic: they are afraid of birds. To save them, you have to build an algorithm that will detect any bird flying over Peacetopia and alert the population.

#### The City Council gives you a dataset of 10,000,000 images of the sky above Peacetopia, taken from the cityâ€™s security cameras. They are labelled:
- y = 0: There is no bird on the image
- y = 1: There is a bird on the image
#### Your goal is to build an algorithm able to classify new images taken by security cameras from Peacetopia.
#### There are a lot of decisions to make:
- What is the evaluation metric?
- How do you structure your data into train/dev/test sets?
### Matric of success
#### The City Council tells you that they want an algorithm that
1.Has high accuracy.
2.Runs quickly and takes only a short time to classify a new image.
3.Can fit in a small amount of memory, so that it can run in a small processor that the city will attach to many different security cameras.
*Note: Having three evaluation metrics makes it harder for you to quickly choose between two different algorithms, and will slow down the speed with which your team can iterate. True/False?
#### True
